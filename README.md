# Color-Color Curve Method

When a supernova (SN) is affected by a non-negligible host galaxy color excess Eh(B-V), the quantification of this value is crucial to accurately infer its physical parameters. In [Rodríguez et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AJ....148..107R/abstract) I showed that for normal Type II SNe (SNe II) the linear B-V versus V-I color-color curve (C3), during the plateau phase, can be used to estimate Eh(B-V) through the method proposed by [Natali et al. 1994](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994A%26A...289..756N/abstract). The latter technique was originally developed to estimate interstellar color excesses for open clusters. The C3 method measures Eh(B-V) from the vertical displacement of an observed V-I versus B-V C3 with respect to a reddening-free one (see [Figure 3](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0004-6256/148/6/107#aj501994f3) of [Rodríguez et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AJ....148..107R/abstract)).

In [Rodríguez et al. (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.483.5459R/abstract) I developed a routine to compute Eh(B-V) given a set of BVI light curves evaluated at the same epochs, called **Color-Color Curve Method (C3M)**. This routine adopts the [Fitzpatrick
(1999)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999PASP..111...63F/abstract) extinction curve with Rv=3.1.
